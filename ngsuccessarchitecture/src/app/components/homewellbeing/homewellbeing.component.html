                    All systems forge equilibrium in order to control the variables outcomes. A desired outcome from a system is always possible and this is in essence what engineered systems are designed and built for. Biological systems, on the other hand, create their own controlled outcomes. The biological process of maintaining body weight is so complex hence the forces and energies that regulate it are too many to count. Food intake is a major component in what regulates all our body functions to keep us alive. Our recent advancement in technology has made it possible to scientifically discover so many of these variables. We continue to read about the recent breakthroughs in nutritional science and the various functions of hormones. Discoveries are still being made to uncover how our body works. In spite of the technical advancement, science is still vague on so many fronts in our body functions. As a result, nutritional science is full of controversy and theories that are in so many cases unproven scientifically. There are so many diets and nutrition plans and camps with different conflicting ideas and views about how we should be maintaining a proper body weight.
                    This course will teach you how to discover the optimal diet for you personally and for your best functioning brain.
