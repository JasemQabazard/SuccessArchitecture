              The other reason I am so enthusiastic about training this special creative universal secret, which transcends our core, is the scientific foundation of its principles. Unlike some other theories in self development and self contained energy it is not built on pseudo scientific hopes and wishes. Creative Success Architecture is found on the most solid System Engineering principles. It has roots in the principles of equilibrium found in the environment, and natural siences such as Physics, Chemistry, Artificial Intelligence, and Neurology. That being said, it does not mean it underminding the immense energy that could be yours for the taking once you implement its process.

This science that will open new horizons for you and your loved ones. I am constantly thrilled and amazed every now and then by the implications that unfold for me since 1980.
